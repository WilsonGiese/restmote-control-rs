# RESTMote Control

## What is this?
RESTMote Control is an application that allows you to expose REST services to
send keyboard events to a specified application. Inspired by Twitch Plays Pokemon,
I wanted to create an application that could achieve something similar while being
application agnostic.

## Tasks
- [x] Send keyboard events to a specified application on OSX with CG Framework
- [x] Create REST services to invoke keyboard events
- [x] Configurable with simple JSON formatted file
- [ ] Interface with Windows SendKeys API (Stretch)
- [ ] Linux compatible (Stretch)

## Disclaimer
This project has just begun and is no where near ready to use
