# RESTMote Control

## What is this?
RESTMote Control is an application that allows you to expose REST services to
send keyboard events to a specified application. Inspired by Twitch Plays Pokemon,
I wanted to create an application that could achieve something similar while being
application agnostic.

## Tasks
- [ ] Send keyboard events to a specified application on OSX with AppleScript
- [ ] Create REST services to invoke keyoard events
- [ ] Configurable with simple JSON (or something else?) formatted file
- [ ] Instead of AppleScript, use CGEvent to send keyoard events
- [ ] Interface with Windows SendKeys API (Stretch)
- [ ] Linux compatible (Stretch)

## Disclaimer
This project has just begun and is no where near ready to use
